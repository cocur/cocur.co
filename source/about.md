## About Cocur

Cocur is a collection of carefully crafted open source libraries created by [Florian Eckerstorfer](https://florian.ec). Most of the times I create these libraries because I wrote the code for another project and I want to give it back to the open source community. Sometimes I create a library because of boredom or fun.

All code I write is well tested and contains good documentation. I believe that it is useless to publish source code that is not tested and documentated.
